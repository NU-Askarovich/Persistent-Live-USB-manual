## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why Persistent Live USB?

There are several ways to run Ubuntu:

- Install it alongside Windows
- Use it in a virtual machine
- Run it as a **bootable USB**

But this tutorial teaches you how to create a **Persistent Live USB**.

With a Persistent Live USB:

- Ubuntu is **stored on your flash drive**
- You can **work on any device**, keeping files, programs, and settings
- You are **not dependent on any specific computer**
- It works **like a mini portable Linux system**

## Comparison: Bootable Flash vs Persistent USB

| Property                | Bootable Flash | Persistent USB |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Saves data             | ‚ùå No          | ‚úÖ Yes         |
| Can install programs   | ‚ùå No          | ‚úÖ Yes         |
| Used for installation  | ‚úÖ Yes         | ‚úÖ Yes         |
| Suitable for daily use | ‚ùå No          | ‚úÖ Yes         |
| Resource usage         | üü¢ Low         | üü° Medium      |


As you can see, **Persistent Live USB is more powerful**, but it requires more time and effort to configure.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Required

To create a Persistent Live USB, you'll need:

### üîß Basic Requirements:
- **First flash memory** ‚Äî For the Ubuntu ISO file (used only for installation).
- **Second flash memory** ‚Äî For installing and running Ubuntu itself.
- **Laptop or PC** ‚Äî Any device that supports booting from USB.

---

### üß™ Example Configuration Used:

- **First Flash Memory:**  
  USB 2.0, 64GB, Apacer AH333 (can be even 16 GB, just enough for ISO file)

- **Second Flash Memory:**  
  64GB Kingston DataTraveler Exodia M, USB 3.2

- **Laptop:**  
  Acer Aspire 7, Core i7, 9th Gen  

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Recommendations:

- **Empty Drives:**  
  Make sure both flash drives are empty ‚Äî all data will be erased.

- **USB Speed Matters:**  
  Use USB 3.0 or higher for the **second** flash drive (Ubuntu itself) to ensure fast installation and usage.

- **Storage Size:**  
  Avoid using flash drives below 32 GB ‚Äî it will cause issues with saving files.  
  **Recommended size: 64 GB**

- **Durability Note:**  
  Running Ubuntu directly from a flash drive causes heat, which can reduce the flash drive‚Äôs lifespan.
